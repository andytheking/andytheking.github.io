      <ul>
        <li class="leo">
          <strong>Leonardo</strong> - The oldest and most mature of the brothers, Leonardo possesses all the qualities of a natural leader. He wears a blue mask and his signature weapons are twin katanas. As leader of the team, he spends most of his time training and honing his skills.
        </li>
        <li class="Raph">
          <strong>Raphael</strong> - Raphael is moody, aggressive and loves to fight. He has a bad temper and has been known to sometimes lose control, particularly when his brothers are in danger. He may have an attitude, but his heart is usually in the right place. He wears a red mask and wields twin sais.
        </li>
        <li class="Don">
          <strong>Donatello</strong> - The brains of the group, Donatello possesses a genius-level intellect and has a natural affinity for science and technology. He wears a purple mask and wields a wooden bo staff (which sometimes has a hidden blade), but his scientific prowess far surpasses his ninja skills and he often builds new weapons and gadgets for he and his brothers to use in battle.
        </li>
        <li class="Mik">
          <strong>Michelangelo</strong> - The youngest of the turtles and least mature. He often jokes around and has a short attention span, but in spite of his regular foolishness, Michelangelo seems to possess more natural talent than his brothers combined. He wields nunchaku in combat and his fighting style is mostly improvised rather than conforming to Splinter's teachings. He wears an orange mask.
